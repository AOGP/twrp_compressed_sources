# TWRP Compressed Sources

### Compressed Repo Folders of Custom Recovery Projects

Sometimes it is hard to get the _repo files_ to build _TWRP_
:worried:

That's why I used _Regalstreak_'s Project *Skadoosh* by slightly modifying as my [_tranSkadooSH_](https://github.com/rokibhasansagar/tranSkadooSH). :smirk:

But I also modified this so as to work with _Travis CI_ and release the files on GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/rokibhasansagar/twrp_compressed_sources/releases) instead of [AFH](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=270268).

### **Work_In_Progress**
